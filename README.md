# Ongaku Ryoho
A music player / library (without the storage option)

## So where's my music supposed to come from?
+ Ongaku Ryoho Server ([gist](https://gist.github.com/1541927))
+ Amazon S3 buckets

> **To add a S3 bucket**, you need place a json file (that contains the information about the music) generated by [this](https://gist.github.com/2078286) somewhere in the S3 bucket. Why? Because otherwise this application would need to download each track seperately to get its tags. There might be a better way, but I still need to find it.

## Specs
+ MongoDB
+ Rails 3.2
+ Backbone.js / jQuery
+ SoundManager2

## How?
Boot it up like so:

    cd wherever_you_cloned_this_project_to
    rails s
    open http://localhost:3000
